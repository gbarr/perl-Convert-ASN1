I consider Convert::ASN1 a replacement for my earlier Convert::BER
module. While ASN1.pm is not as flexable as BER.pm, because PDUs must
be described up fronta, it is also more powerful.  For example an LDAP
filter is a recursive structure, BER.pm cannot encode or decode this in
a single pass, ASN1.pm can.

Convert::ASN1 will parse ASN.1 descriptions and will encode from and
decode to perl data structures using a hierarchy of references.
